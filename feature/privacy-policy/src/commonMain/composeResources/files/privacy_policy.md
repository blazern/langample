**Privacy Policy**

Danil Garmanov built the `lexisoup` app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Danil Garmanov at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**
Whenever you use my Service, I collect the following data to improve the Service:
- your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address
- your lexical queries (e.g. "cat", "book", etc)

The purpose of collecting this data is to investigate software bugs and improve the Service.

No additional personal information beyond what is described above is collected by me.
Most data is automatically deleted after a short retention period. Deletion requests apply to any remaining stored data.
You can request me to delete any data received from you by contacting me through my email: danil.garmanov@protonmail.com.

**Service Providers**
My Service uses third-party services which also may receive certain data necessary for their functionality (for example, analytics or crash information).
They process this data under their own privacy policies.

Next third party services are directly incorporated into the `lexisoup` app and may collect data independently to facilitate software improvements (this may include basic device information, crash logs, and usage statistics):
- Google Play Services: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Next third party services receive network requests from `lexisoup` and thus may receive your device’s IP address and lexical queries as part of standard network requests:
- Tatoeba: https://tatoeba.org/en/terms_of_use
- Kaikki: https://kaikki.org/
- Wortschatz Leipzig: https://wortschatz-leipzig.de/en/privacy
No personal identifiers are being sent to these services.

The following services are queried indirectly (through the `lexisoup` server) and thus the only information they receive are the user's lexical queries (e.g. "cat", "book", etc):
- ChatGPT: https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/

You may see mentioning of the PanLex service inside the app. But the PanLex service is not being used directly (and this receives no user data). Instead, its publicly accessible database is uploaded to my service and is used fully separately from the PanLex service itself.

**Security**
I value your trust in providing your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Children’s Privacy**
The Service is not specifically directed at children under the age of 16. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. In the case I discover that a child under 16 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from my server. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with their personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take necessary actions.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

**Contact me**
If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at danil.garmanov@protonmail.com.
